TGLStackedViewController
========================

A stack layout with gesture-based reordering using UICollectionView -- inspired by Passbook and Reminders apps.

What's new in 2.0
------------------

* Uses iOS 9 collection view reordering API instead of own implementation, therefore minimum deployment target is iOS 9.0
* Unexposed items are pinned to bottom by default, now 
* The exposed item can be collapsed interactively in addition to tapping it
    * When pinning (the default) pan item down to switch back to stacked layout
    * When just pushing cards aside use pinch gesture instead
* Improved sample project w/ lots of settings to tweak interactively

Getting Started
===============

Take a look at sample project `TGLStackedViewExample.xcodeproj`. You may use sample class `TGLViewController` as a starting point for your own implementation. 

Usage
=====

Via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org):

* Add `pod 'TGLStackedViewController', '~> 2.0'` to your project's `Podfile`

Or the "classic" way:

* Add files in folder `TGLStackedViewController` to your project

Then in your project:

* Create a subclass derived from `TGLStackedViewController`
* Implement the `UICollectionViewDataSource` protocol in your subclass
    * *Currently only 1 section is supported* therefore your implementation of `-numberOfSectionsInCollectionView` *has to* return `1`. `TGLStackedViewController` provides a suitable implementation for you -- no need to overwrite.
    * Implement methods `-numberOfSectionsInCollectionView:` and `-collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath` as usual.
    * **New in 2.0**: `TGLStackedViewController`'s implementation of method `-collectionView:canMoveItemAtIndexPath:` checks for stacked layout and a minimum number of 2 items before allowing reordering. Make sure to call `super` in your implementation and honor it's result.
    * **New in 2.0**: Implement method `-collectionView:moveItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:` to update your data model after items have been reordered
* Implement the `UICollectionViewDelegate` protocol in your subclass
    * `TGLStackedViewController` already implements methods `-collectionView:shouldHighlightItemAtIndexPath:`, `-collectionView:didDeselectItemAtIndexPath`, and `-collectionView:didSelectItemAtIndexPath:` internally, so make sure to call `super` in your implementation.
    * Method `-collectionView:targetContentOffsetForProposedContentOffset:` is crucuial for properly transitioning betwenn exposed and stacked layout, so make sure to call `super` in your implementation.
* Place `UICollectionViewController` in your storyboard and set its class to your derived class
    * Make sure to set up the collection view's `delegate` and `dataSource` connections properly
* **New in 2.0**: `TGLStackedViewController` does no longer create a layout object internally.
    * Set the collection view controller's layout class to `TGLStackedLayout` or your own subclass of `TGLStackedLayout` in the inspector in Interface Builder.
    * When creating a `TGLStackedViewController` in code you have to set the collection view's layout before presenting the view controller.

Requirements
============

* ARC
* iOS >= 9.0
* Xcode 7.3
